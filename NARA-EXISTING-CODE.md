# Existing Codebase Onboarding

This document is intentionally minimal to avoid duplicating canonical specs.

## Canonical References

- `specs/cli/adopt.md` is the source of truth for onboarding behavior.
- `specs/files/formats.md` defines required story sections for adopted codebases.
- `nara/seed/` is the canonical seed content used by the CLI.

## Note

If information in this file conflicts with anything under `.nara/`, the `.nara/` directory is canonical.
