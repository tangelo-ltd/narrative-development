# AI Agent Instructions

This is a Narrative Development project. Specifications are the source of truth.
Canonical narrative artifacts live under `specs/`.

## Start Here

1. Read `INDEX.md`
2. Then read `specs/conventions/index.md`

## Rules

1. **Read the index first:** Start with `INDEX.md`, then `specs/conventions/index.md`
2. **Do not invent requirements:** Only implement what is specified
3. **Ask when uncertain:** Surface missing information as questions
4. **Be token-efficient:** Load only the files you need
5. **No code edits unless asked:** Do not change runtime code unless explicitly requested
6. **Respect story boundaries:** One capability per story

## Entry Points

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Start here | `INDEX.md` |
| All conventions | `specs/conventions/index.md` |
| All stories | `specs/stories/` |
| Project intent | `specs/manifest.md` |
| Vocabulary | `specs/glossary.md` |

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add requirements not in specifications
- Do not modify conventions without explicit instruction
- Do not generate code unless asked
- Do not load the entire repository into context
